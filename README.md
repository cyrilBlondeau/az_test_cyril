### Prerequisites

1. A fully functional and up to date node + yarn environment


### Quick start

1. Clone this project
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`
4. Code :)
5. And don't forget to lint your code!

:information_source: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


### TODO :

1. Implement the edit and delete actions
2. Add the logic to check / uncheck items
3. This list sounds a bit ephemeral, how could we make it a bit more persistent? (client only solution)

#### Going further :

- Maybe add some filters, to quickly find bought and not bought yet items
- I was a bit lazy with the style, feel free to add as much CSS as you want
- Same with the tests :scream:
- Any other improvement, suggestion? Go on and show us :)
